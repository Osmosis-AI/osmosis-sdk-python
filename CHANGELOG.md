## 0.3.0rc1 - 2026-07-28

### Breaking Changes

- Each rollout now produces one `RolloutSample` and one reward; migrate `samples` mappings to `sample`, `register_sample_source()` to `set_sample_source()`, and `set_sample_reward()` to `set_reward()` ([#235](https://github.com/Osmosis-AI/osmosis-sdk-python/pull/235)).
- Routing now uses rollout-scoped chat-completion and callback URLs; per-call routing headers were removed, request-body `rollout_id` is optional, and `RolloutSample.id` and `MultiTurnMode` no longer exist ([#235](https://github.com/Osmosis-AI/osmosis-sdk-python/pull/235)).
- Harbor and local backends now exchange `sample.json` and write `reward.json` as `{"reward": <float>}` ([#235](https://github.com/Osmosis-AI/osmosis-sdk-python/pull/235)).
